# Admin Screen Review

In the JobAndApplicationsManager project, I developed the admin screen to help managers manage job postings and handle job applications that have been posted.

## Dynamic Data View
- **Real-time data:** Current data is retrieved and displayed from the database.
- **Clear layout:** Data is organized for easy scanning.

## Job and Application Management
- **CRUD operations:** Enable adding, editing, and deleting jobs and applications.

## User Experience Improvement
- **Intuitive Design:** Created a user-friendly interface.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes modals, tooltips, and feedback messages.
